Todays development: (Effort spent : canvas study : 2 hrs + work : 3.5 hrs)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Image loading to canvas
-> drawing and forming  mouseup and mousedown events
->  Logic of image selection when crop border selects - i.e marquee options
-> One side fixed cropping..

Next agenda:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Create 4 anchor points (or 8)
-> Move them and finally get the coordinates
-> Crop and display in canvas

Improvement areas:
-------------------------------------------------
-> Browser compatibility .. ( dont know at the end I saw it works only with chrome..)
-> No architecture followed, functions called as and when required. Better to form the event logic and flow
-> Need to learn about industry standard coding.. ( I saw some examples related to canvas compatibility.. It was nicely written..)
-> GUI

Questions :
------------------------------------------------
1.  Is this approach ok ? suggestions please
2.  I had an idea of using sliders (as an easy way), instead of using drag and select..
3. Am I too slow? I really don't know how much time is this going to take. But this is interesting enough to keep me awake till late night..)
